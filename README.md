## Introduction

Dory is a self-driving robot that evolves through multiple phases, starting from a basic kit assembly to becoming a miniature self-driving car. The goal for this project is to touch base on different autonomous vehicles tech and hands-on building them! This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and guidance on the upcoming phases, showcasing the evolution of Dory from a basic kit assembly to a miniature self-driving car.

## Features

- Kit assembly with wheels, breadboard, engines, and battery case.
- Motion-activated guard robot
- Light-tracking robot
- Line-tracking robot
- Obstacle-avoiding robot
- Miniature self-driving car

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Kit Assembly
In this phase, I assemble the basic robot kit named Dory.

*Watch Dory's Kit Assembly.*

### Phase 2: Motion-Activated Guard Robot
Transform Dory into a motion-activated guard robot. This phase focuses on implementing motion detection and response mechanisms. Begin by assembling the circuit, mounting the PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, and conducting thorough testing to ensure optimal functionality.

*See Dory as a Motion-Activated Guard Robot in action.*

### Phase 3: Light-Tracking Robot (Coming Soon!)
Enhance Dory's capabilities by making it capable of tracking and following light sources. **Expected release - 01/23/2024**

*Watch Dory's Light-Tracking capabilities.*

### Phase 4: Line-Tracking Robot
Implement line-tracking algorithms to enable Dory to follow predefined paths.

*Dory demonstrating Line-Tracking.*

### Phase 5: Obstacle Avoiding Robot
Equip Dory with obstacle avoidance capabilities using sensors to navigate its environment.

*Observe Dory's Obstacle Avoidance capabilities. (Coming Soon)*

### Phase 6: Miniature Self-Driving Car
The final phase involves turning Dory into a miniature self-driving car. Implement computer vision and machine learning techniques for autonomous navigation.
*Experience Dory as a Miniature Self-Driving Car. (Coming Soon)*
